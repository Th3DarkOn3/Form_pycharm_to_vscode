# VSCode Python Project Settings

This guide is useful for anyone switching from PyCharm to VSCode.

### Steps to set up:

1. Create a Python virtual environment in your project folder:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   ```

2. Create a `.vscode` folder in the root of your project:
   ```bash
   mkdir .vscode
   ```

3. Copy the `settings.json` file from this repository into the `.vscode` folder.

Thatâ€™s it! Your VSCode project is now configured.
